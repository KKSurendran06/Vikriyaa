                    our platform strives to cultivate a community that unites surplus donors with those in need. Vikriyaa is more than a platform;

                    and businesses to share their surplus, we aspire to create a world where no resource goes to waste and every contribution makes a 
                    meaningful difference in combating hunger and promoting sustainability</p>

                that is not only effortless but also profoundly rewarding. We are committed to simplifying the surplus donation process, ensuring that 
                individuals, restaurants, and businesses can easily contribute to a positive cause. Through Vikriyaa, surplus transcends mere excess; 
                it becomes a catalyst for good, unlocking its full potential to address food scarcity and environmental concerns. By making surplus a 
                force for positive change, we aim to build a community where each donation creates a lasting impact, contributing to a more compassionate 
                and sustainable world.
